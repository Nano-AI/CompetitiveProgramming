# CompetitiveProgramming 
A collection of practice problems.

## Setup
I write my solutions in C++ with Sublime Text and Vim Keybinds using NeoVintageous with the Grub theme.

Solutions are written in C++ using Sublime Text.

I use the [NeoVintagous](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/NeoVintageous) and [CppFastOlympicCoding](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/CppFastOlympicCoding) plugins, and use the Gruvbox theme.
